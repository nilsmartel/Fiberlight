# Fiberlight
3D Rendering Engine written in Java

might be changed to C-language later

it's a personal project I'm working on, there are no concerns about serious performance etc., since this is just and Experiment.

at the moment it's only supporting the .obj file format.

compiling and running

  $ javac Viewer.java
  
  $ java Viewer path/to/file.obj
