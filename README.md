_I'm mentally in a much better place now, thanks for asking_

it's a personal project I'm working on, there are no concerns about serious performance etc., since this is just an experiment.

At the moment it's only supporting the .obj file format.

# Compiling and running
go to `src` directory and

  $ javac Viewer.java

  $ java Viewer path/to/file.obj


# Note

this is an old project of mine, back when I just started learning java and about OO programming. Any skilled programmer can point out code snippets, that just don't make sense from an object oriented perspective (e.g. my struggle to grasp 'static' is a great example).

Looking back at this project after some years I still very much like it. I just started going to university, had huge struggles with linear algebra/vector-math and allocating my time. This was a major accomplishment and it still runs just fine.
